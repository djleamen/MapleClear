# Indigenous Language Features - Ethical Guidelines

## Community-First Approach

### Consent and Collaboration
- **Principle**: No Indigenous language features without explicit community permission
- **Process**: Direct engagement with language communities and rights holders
- **Documentation**: Written permission required before implementation
- **Attribution**: Clear credit to contributing communities and resources

### Current Status: EXPERIMENTAL
All Indigenous language features are:
- Clearly labeled as experimental
- Opt-in only (disabled by default)
- Side-by-side with English (never replacement)
- Linked to community-approved resources

## Planned Features (Pending Community Approval)

### Inuktitut Support
- **Status**: Concept phase - no implementation yet
- **Approach**: Dictionary-powered glosses for common government terms
- **Community Partner**: [To be determined through proper channels]
- **Scope**: Limited to basic assistance, not full translation

### Implementation Requirements
Before any Indigenous language feature is activated:
1. Written consent from appropriate language authorities
2. Community review of all terminology and translations
3. Ongoing oversight and feedback mechanisms
4. Revenue sharing if commercial use develops
5. Right to withdraw consent at any time

## Respect for Cultural Ownership

### Language Rights
- Indigenous communities own their languages
- Cultural protocols must be followed
- Sacred or ceremonial terms excluded
- Focus on practical government terminology only

### Data Sovereignty
- Community data stays with communities
- No cloud storage of Indigenous language data without consent
- Local processing respects data sovereignty principles
- Transparent data handling policies

## Technical Safeguards

### Quality Control
- Limited scope to prevent misrepresentation
- Conservative accuracy thresholds
- Frequent community review cycles
- User education about limitations

### Clear Boundaries
- Assistance only, never authoritative translation
- Government terminology focus (not cultural content)
- Professional interpreters recommended for official matters
- Links to official community language resources

## Community Benefit

### Capacity Building
- Training opportunities for community members
- Technical skills transfer
- Resource development support
- Long-term sustainability planning

### Reciprocal Relationship
- Community needs drive feature development
- Regular consultation and feedback
- Adaptation based on community preferences
- Recognition of community expertise
