        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Canada Child Benefit (<span class="acronym">CCB</span>) is a tax-free monthly payment made to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age. The <span class="acronym">CCB</span> might include the child disability benefit and any related provincial and territorial programs.</p>

        <div class="complex-text">
            <h3>Eligibility criteria and entitlement determination</h3>
            <p>To be entitled to receive the <span class="acronym">CCB</span>, you must meet all of the following conditions on the first day of the month for which the <span class="acronym">CRA</span> calculates your entitlement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you must be resident in Canada for income tax purposes</li>
                <li>you or your spouse or common-law partner must be a Canadian citizen, a protected person, a temporary resident who has lived in Canada for the previous 18 months, or an Indian as defined under the Indian Act</li>
                <li>you must be the primary caregiver of a child under the age of 18</li>
                <li>the child must be resident in Canada, unless the child is only temporarily outside of Canada for a period of less than 12 months</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Payment calculation methodology</h3>
        <p>The <span class="acronym">CCB</span> is calculated based on your family's adjusted net income from the previous year, the number of children in your care, and their ages. The benefit is subject to income testing, which means that higher-income families receive a reduced benefit amount or may not be eligible at all.</p>

        <div class="complex-text">
            <p>For the 2023-24 benefit year (July 2023 to June 2024), you could receive a maximum of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$7,437 per year ($619.75 per month) for each eligible child under the age of 6</li>
                <li>$6,275 per year ($522.91 per month) for each eligible child aged 6 through 17</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your adjusted family net income is over $34,863, your <span class="acronym">CCB</span> payments will be reduced. The reduction is calculated at a rate of 7% of the amount by which your adjusted family net income exceeds $34,863 for families with one child, plus an additional 13.5% for families with two children, plus an additional 19% for families with three children, and plus an additional 23% for families with four or more children.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Application process and required documentation</h3>
        <p>To apply for the <span class="acronym">CCB</span>, you need to complete Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits Application. You must also provide supporting documents, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>documents that prove the child's birth (such as a birth certificate or registration of birth)</li>
            <li>documents that prove you live with the child</li>
            <li>if you have a spouse or common-law partner, documents that prove their identity and your relationship status</li>
            <li>if you or your spouse or common-law partner is not a Canadian citizen, documents that prove your status in Canada</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Related programs and benefits coordination</h3>
        <p>The <span class="acronym">CCB</span> may affect your eligibility for other benefits and credits. These include but are not limited to the <span class="acronym">GST</span>/<span class="acronym">HST</span> credit, provincial and territorial child benefits, and the Canada Workers Benefit (<span class="acronym">CWB</span>). Additionally, if your child has a severe and prolonged mental or physical impairment, they may be eligible for the child disability benefit, which provides additional support.</p>

        <div class="complex-text">
            <h4>Provincial and territorial program integration</h4>
            <p>Several provinces and territories have integrated their child benefit programs with the federal <span class="acronym">CCB</span>. This means that when you apply for the <span class="acronym">CCB</span>, you are automatically considered for provincial or territorial benefits. However, some provinces and territories require separate applications. You should contact your provincial or territorial government to understand what programs are available in your area and how to apply.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Payment schedule and direct deposit information</h3>
        <p>The <span class="acronym">CRA</span> usually issues <span class="acronym">CCB</span> payments on the 20th of each month. If the 20th falls on a weekend or statutory holiday, you will receive your payment on the next business day. To receive your payments, you must have direct deposit set up with the <span class="acronym">CRA</span>. You can set up direct deposit through your <span class="acronym">CRA</span> My Account online, by calling the <span class="acronym">CRA</span>, or by submitting a direct deposit request form.</p>

        <h3>Income reporting obligations and recalculation procedures</h3>
        <p>Your <span class="acronym">CCB</span> payments are based on information from your income tax and benefit return. It is important that you file your return by the due date each year, even if you have no income to report. If you do not file your return, your <span class="acronym">CCB</span> payments will stop. Additionally, if your family situation changes (such as a change in marital status, number of children, or custody arrangements), you must inform the <span class="acronym">CRA</span> immediately, as this may affect your benefit amount.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
    <footer>
            <p>The <span class="acronym">CRA</span> will recalculate your <span class="acronym">CCB</span> entitlement based on your actual income when you file your tax return. If you received more than your correct entitlement, you may have to repay the overpayment. The <span class="acronym">CRA</span> may recover overpayments by reducing future benefit payments or by other collection methods authorized under the Income Tax Act.</p>
